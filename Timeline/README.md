# Timeline graphical interface for message control in Max

This "timeline" object aims to address the problem of simple temporal writing in Max. This problem can be summarized in two parts. The first part relates to how the evolution of a sound parameter is written throughout a composition. The second part concerns how this evolution can be easily represented to comprehend the overall structure and its correlation with other parameters. These problems cannot be solved with the traditional message approach where the composer writes individual messages that descrives the configuration of multiple objects at one moment. The proposed code involves transitioning from an instantaneous snapshot of time to a more global perspective.
